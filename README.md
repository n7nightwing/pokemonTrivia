Here's the Pokemon Trivia game! It's a fully developed app built using primarily Javascript with no additional libraries. Test your Pokemon trivia knowledge, and be scored on how good of a trainer you are!

It's written in CSS/HTML, and has Javascript DOM manipulation changing the elements on the page.

PS: It's responsive, so go ahead and give it a try on your phone, or tablet!


## Looking to the Future

I'd like to add the timer functionality, and then a leaderboards function that will persist so you can see how you stack up against other trainers! 
Time-based scoring and more questions are also on the docket!
